## What is React?
This is a JavaScript library for user interfaces.
The main characteristic feature is a declarative, component-based, and learns once-Write anywhere.

## What I learned from this project
- How to create react app
- How to create a function
- How to create a hook that allows us to use state and other React features without creating a class.
